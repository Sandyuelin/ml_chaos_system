# ml_chaos_system
Project for MATH303 ODE and Dynamic Systems: using reservoir computing to learn Lyapunov's exponents for chaos system

### Outline:
**Introduction**
- Goal: use machine learning, specifically reservoir computing to learn how chaotic systems behave from observing the data
- Case studies: The Lorenz system and KS

**Reservoir Computing**

**Lyapunov's exponential**

**Example: Lorenz System**
- quality code for simulating the dynamics:
how to train the reservoir and predict future dynamics
- heuristic explanation of how/why this works

**Example: KS**
